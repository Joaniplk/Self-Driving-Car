# Self driving Car Project

In this project I have made AI that based on some input (location of the car relative to objects) will make a decision on where to go with objective being to go as far as possible

* To train the model refresh the page when it's done or whenever you think is fit
* You can change the amount of cars by changing the N variable in index.js (line 8)

With this function  you can get an already trained model: localStorage.setItem("bestBrain", JSON.stringify(/* trained brain json */));
### The trained model can be found in TrainedNetwork.txt

Please mess around with the code and find ways to improve on it
